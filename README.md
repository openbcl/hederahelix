# Simulation of fire spread on green façades
Currently, the fire spread behaviour of green façades is being investigated through real-scale fire tests. On the other hand, Computer-aided fire simulations offer a cost- and time-efficient way to calculate the fire spread behaviour under varying conditions.

Using the "Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)" and the "Complex Pyrolysis Models" it contains, fire spread can be calculated as a function of fuel properties and ambient conditions.

In the context of a Master's thesis at the University of Applied Sciences Magdeburg-Stendal, basic principles for the simulation of fire spread on façades planted with ivy are being developed.

This repository contains the results from fire experiments with ivy (hedera helix) to obtain pyrolysis parameters for simulating fire spread on green façades.
